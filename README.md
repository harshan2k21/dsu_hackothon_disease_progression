 Problem Statement Title:Optimizing Personalized Healthcare Models Using Federated Learning
 ❖Proposed Solution: Developing a federated learning system for hospitals to collaboratively train a 
disease progression model while keeping patient data decentralized and private.
 Detailed solution:
 • Local Model-Each hospital implements a machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) tailored to 
predicting disease progression based on its data.
 • Federated Averaging-The server calculates the average of these parameters and distributes the 
aggregated model back to each hospital.
 • Privacy and security-Uses encryption to aggregate model updates from hospitals in such a way that the 
server can combine the updates without being able to access the individual hospital data. This ensures 
that hospitals’ contributions remain private even during the aggregation process
